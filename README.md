# MLOps_Project

Use Kedro organization and modular code. You can keept your exploration notebooks in your
appropriate folder.
1. Unit data tests: You can use one of the tools from the class or your own solutions, but it is important to have several asserts for the data quality.
2. MLflow for experimentation and model versioning.
3. Data drift evaluation: If you build a pipeline to test a sample of data of your strongest model, include this component as well. 
   You can play with your sample if you want to generate drift, or see how the mtetrics would change if drift happens.
5. Try to build tests for your relevant functions and pipelines.
