## Dataset Requirements

- Data Drift
  - Data drift is the situation where the modelâ€™s input distribution changes.
- Concept Drift
  - Concept drift is the situation when the functional relationship between the model inputs and outputs changes.
  
Option 1:
  Pooled Cross-Sectional Dataset
Option 2:
  Create artificial Dataset and simulate DD & CD
